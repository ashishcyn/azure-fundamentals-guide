### Cloud Concepts  

-----------------
### Why cloud services?

**1.Cloud computing**   

**2.Key concepts**  
 
 * High availability
   ```
   The ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time, with very little downtime    
   ```
 
 * Scalability
   ```
   The ability to increase or decrease resources for any given workload. You can add additional resources   
   to service a workload (known as scaling out), or add additional capabilities to manage an increase in   
   demand to the existing resource (known as scaling up). Scalability doesn't have to be done automatically    
   ```
   
 * Elasticity
   ```
   The ability to automatically or dynamically increase or decrease resources as needed. Elastic resources 
   match the current needs, and resources are added or removed automatically to meet future needs when it√≠s needed, 
   and from the most advantageous geographic location. A distinction between scalability and elasticity is that 
   elasticity is done automatically
   ```
 * Agility
   ```
   The ability to react quickly. 
   Cloud services can allocate and deallocate resources quickly. 
   They are provided on-demand via self-service, so vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes. 
   There is no manual intervention in provisioning or deprovisioning services.
   ```
   
 * Fault tolerence
   ```
   The ability to remain up and running even in the event of a component or service no longer functioning. 
   Typically, redundancy is built into cloud services architecture so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place. 
   The type of service is said to be tolerant of faults.
   ```
   
 * Disaster recovery
   ```
   The ability to recover from an event which has taken down a cloud service. Cloud services disaster recovery can happen very 
   quickly with automation and services being readily available to use.
   ```
   
 * Global reach  
 * Customer latency capabilities  
 * Predictive cost considerations  
 * Technical skill requirements and considerations 
 * Increased productivity 
 * Security  
 
 
**3.Economies of scale**   
  ```
  * The concept of economies of scale is the ability to reduce costs and gain efficiency when operating at a larger scale 
  in comparison to operating at a smaller scale.  
  ```
  
**4.CapEx vs OpEx**  

  In previous years, startup companies needed to acquire a physical premises and infrastructure to start their business and begin trading. 
  Large amounts of money were need to get a new business up and running, or to grow an existing company. 
  They would have to buy new datacenters or new servers to allow them build out new services, which they could then deliver to their customers. 
  That is no longer the case.
  Today, organizations can sign up for a service from a cloud provider to get up and running. This enables them to begin selling or providing 
  services to their customers more quickly, without the need for significant upf ront costs.

  These two approaches to investment are referred to as:  
 
  Capital Expenditure (CapEx):   
  ```
   This is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an up front cost which has a value that reduces over time    
  ```  
     
  Operational Expenditure (OpEx):   
  ```
  This is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There is no up front cost, you pay for a service   or product as you use it.  
  ```
